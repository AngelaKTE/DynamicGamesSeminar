# Design and Analysis of Dynamic Games

## Overview

### Motivation

short overview of the goals of this seminar

### Prerequisites

This course assumes working knowledge of multivariate calculus, linear algebra and optimization. More advanced mathematical topics will build on these areas. Adiitionally, working knowledge of algorithm game theory is assumed. Approaches presented in the course are specific to state based games with many players, many mechanisms and a statespace which includes arbitrary data structures.

Depending on what field you come from, mathematical notation varies. My course material will leverage notation similar to that of Stephen Boyd at Stanford. I recommend his lecture notes on linear systems for getting acquainted with the notion.

## Assignments

### Assignment 0

Read Section 1 (pages 3-72) **Foundations** of *Engineering a Safer World* by Nancy Leveson 

Further reading in this text is recommended but not required. The purpose of this assignment is to ensure we're thinking about the role models play in engineered systems, and how those models effects the sociotechnical systems composed of those engineered systems, humans and other exogenous factors.
